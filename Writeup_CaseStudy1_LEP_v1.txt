The first objective is to clean and tidy the data so that it is ready for input to the statistical analysis package. This involved converting the UTF-8 format data provided as input for the beer and brewery csv files, rearranging row and column data for inputs and removing duplicate observations for statistical analysis in R. 
Output csv file deliverables, the code base for data conditioning and date analysis can be found in the project directory. For a more detailed description of the files, please refer to the codebook also found in the project directory.

“Brewery Per State Chart”
The graph (and table?) above was derived from the brewery dataset and illustrates the number of craft breweries found in each state, from Colorado with 47 breweries to West Virginia, South Dakota and North Dakota with only one brewery each. There is a brewery in Washington, DC but this observation was excluded since it is not defined as a state.

The beer and brewery datasets were merged by Brewery ID number. For quality control purposes, the first and last six observations are listed below.

There were 62 NA’s in the ABV (Alcohol By Volume) column and 998 NA’s in the IBU (International Bitterness Unit) column (see below). To ensure consistency, these rows were omitted in the ABV vs IBU analysis performed later in the study.

"Median Alcohol By Volume vs. Median International Bitterness Unit by State" Chart

The bar plot above was derived by normalizing median values of ABV (Alcohol By Volume) and IBU (International Bitterness Units) to a range of 0 to 1 and plotting them in pairs by increasing values by state. There appears to be a strong positive correlation between median alcohol content by volume and the bitterness unit values observed in this dataset.
5. 
The beer with the highest alcoholic content (with an ABV value of 0.125 or 12.5%) is “London Balling English Barleywine”, brewed by Against the Grain Brewery in Louisville, KY.
The bitterest beer (with an IBU value of 138) is “Bitter Bitch Imperial IPA American Double”, brewed by the Astoria Brewing Company in Astoria, OR.
6.
The summary statistics for the ABV (Alcohol By Volume) variable are listed below:
  Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
0.02700 0.05000 0.05700 0.06007 0.06800 0.12500
7. 
"Alcohol by Volume (ABV) vs. International Bitterness Unit (IBU)" scatter plot
The scatter plot above was derived by plotting median values of ABV (Alcohol By Volume) against median values of IBU (International Bitterness Units). The linear regression line includes a shaded 95% confidence interval. There is good evidence for a positive correlation between ABV and IBU values in this data set.
