# Notes
# If anyone sees a way to steamline this code, go for it. I went for minimal but understandable (to me at least).
# We could check for column similarity prior to merge, but I figured I would do that only if there was a problem
# Data frame names probably could be improved
# It would be cool if we could put the regression equation and r**2 on the final plot. I could not get it to work.
