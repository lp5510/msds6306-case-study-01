# Notes
# If anyone sees a way to steamline this code, go for it. I went for minimal but understandable (to me at least).
# We could check for column similarity prior to merge, but I figured I would do that only if there was a problem
# Data frame names probably could be improved
# It would be cool if we could put the regression equation and r**2 on the final plot. I could not get it to work.

===========================================================

# Beers and Breweries dataset cleaning

library(dplyr)

# read beer csv
# Use read.csv to read in beer.csv file 
beer <- read.csv("Beers.csv", header = TRUE, sep=",", row.names = NULL)

utils::View(beer)

# Use read.csv to read in Breweries.csv file 
brwy <- read.csv("Breweries.csv", header = TRUE, sep=",", row.names = NULL)

# Beer file

# Special character replacement/removal

# Replace "â€™" with "'"
beer$Name <- gsub("â€™", "'", beer$Name)

# Replace "Ã¶" with "o"
beer$Name <- gsub("Ã¶", "o", beer$Name)

# Replace "Â°" with "°"
beer$Name <- gsub("Â°", "°", beer$Name)

# Replace "Ã©" with "e'"
beer$Name <- gsub("Ã©", "e'", beer$Name)

# Replace "Ã" with "i'"
beer$Name <- gsub("Ã", "i'", beer$Name)

# Replace "'¼" with "o'"
beer$Name <- gsub("'¼", "o", beer$Name)

# Remove "â„¢" character
beer$Name <- gsub("â„¢", "", beer$Name)

# Replace "Ã¶" with "o"
beer$Style <- gsub("Ã¶", "o", beer$Style)

# Replace "Ã¤" with "a"
beer$Style <- gsub("Ã¤", "a", beer$Style)

# Replace "Ã¨" with "e"
beer$Style <- gsub("Ã¨", "e", beer$Style)

# Brewery file

# Replace "Ã¶" with "o"
brewery$Name <- gsub("Ã¶", "o", brewery$Name)

==========================================================

==========================================================

# Questions:
# 1) Breweries per state?

# Count breweries per state
BwryPerState <- count(brwy, State)

# in beer df rename column "Brewery_id"" to "Brew_ID" 
BwryPerState <- rename(BwryPerState, Breweries = n)

# 2) Merge beer and brewery data. Print first and last 6 observations

# QC
str(beer)
summary(beer)

summary(brwy)

# Merge data frames
beerbrew <- dplyr::inner_join(beer, brwy, by = "Brew_ID")

str(beerbrew)

# Check beerbrew

head(beerbrew,6)
tail(beerbrew,6)

# 3) Report NA in each column

sapply(beerbrew, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# 4) Median ABV and IBU by state. Plot barchart.

#NA removal (all)
beerbrew <- beerbrew[complete.cases(beerbrew), ]

# normalize and dual barplot ggplot here ***********************************************



# 5) State with highest ABV? Highest IBU?
	 
# Most alcoholic beer (Kentucky)
dplyr::top_n(beerbrew, 1, ABV)

# Most bitter beer (Oregon)
dplyr::top_n(beerbrew, 1, IBU)

# 6) Summary statistics for the ABV variable

summary(beerbrew$ABV)

# 7) Generate scatter plot ABV vs IBU. Positive correlation between ABV and IBU
# could be dressed up

ggplot(beerbrew, aes(x=IBU, y=ABV)) +
    geom_point(shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
    geom_smooth(method=lm)   # Add linear regression line 
                             #  (by default includes 95% confidence region)
